PipelineGridSearchCV
====================
An optimzed version of GridSearchCV and Pipeline that
avoids unnecessary calls to fit()/transform() by doing grid search in
depth first search (DFS) order.

Motivation
==========
Running GridSearchCV on a Pipeline classifier will cause
a full pipeline computation for each set of parameters,
despite some parameters being the same as before,
causing unnecessary calls to fit/transform.

Doing 5-fold CV using GridSearchCV on a Pipeline will
cause prod(param_counts)*pipe_length*5+pipe_length calls to fit(),
where pipe_length is the length of the pipeline.

PipelineGridSearchCV, on the other hand, requires only the optimal
(nverts-1)*5+pipe_length calls to fit(),
where nverts is the number of vertices in the pipeline parameter call
tree.

Usage
=====
$ python examples/example.py
-----------------------------------
Elapsed time for doing grid search:
PipelineGridSearchCV: 12.456952095 secs
GridSearchCV: 38.9708809853 secs

Tests
=====
Make sure that everything is working correctly by running the test suite:
$ make test
